# ![TiteCan](src/main/resources/public/favicon-32x32.png) INV - Intertwined network valuables

***INV*** is a tool intended to facilitate the implementation of an *environment as a code* solution in your technological ecosystem.  
It is completely generic, complementing automation with code instead of only configuration files.   
It enables such features by ***sequencing intertwined network valuables***. These valuables could be your Mysql databases, your dotNet core apps, your AWS web services, your Azure servers, etc.  
Basically, **anything** collaborating within your ecosystem.  

**INV** does not replace any of your actual network valuables. It only facilitates the communication and data exchange between then.

**INV** is a free, on-prem, java/groovy based solution.
